Contact Management: Provides CRUD functionality for managing contacts, including adding new contacts, viewing existing contacts, updating contact information, and deleting contacts.
Responsive Design: Utilizes HTML and CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface that adapts to various devices and screen sizes.
Data Persistence: Utilizes Spring Data JPA for seamless integration with a relational database, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of contact information.
Security: Implements security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to the application, enhancing user privacy and confidentiality.

Technologies Used
HTML: Used for structuring the content and elements of the web application.
CSS: Provides styling to enhance the visual appearance and layout of the application.
JavaScript: Implements client-side functionality for dynamic interactions and user experience enhancements.
Spring Boot: Provides a robust framework for building and deploying web applications with minimal configuration.
Spring Security: Ensures secure authentication and authorization within the application, protecting against unauthorized access.
Spring Data JPA: Facilitates seamless interaction with a relational database, simplifying data access and manipulation.

Functionality
User Registration: Allows users to register for an account with a username and password.
User Login: Provides secure login functionality for authenticated access to the application.
Contact CRUD Operations: Enables users to perform CRUD operations on contacts, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting contacts.
Role-based Access Control: Assigns roles to users (e.g., admin, user) to control access to different features and functionalities within the application.

Customization
Styling: Customize the appearance of the application by modifying CSS styles to match branding or design preferences.

Delete Contact: Remove unwanted contacts from the database to maintain data accuracy and cleanliness.

Notes
The Smart Contact Manager project demonstrates the integration of frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with backend frameworks (Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA) to build a robust and secure web application.
It serves as a practical example of how to implement CRUD operations with authentication and authorization features in a real-world scenario.
Continuous maintenance and updates may be required to address security vulnerabilities, improve performance, and add new features based on evolving requirements.
